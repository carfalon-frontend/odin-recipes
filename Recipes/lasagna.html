        <p>Homemade lasagna takes time and work to make correct, but the smiling faces of your family and friends is worth the effort.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>It is common knowledge that traditional lasagna takes time to make if you plan on making it yourself. The layering, seasoning, preparing, there isn't a step that can be rushed if you want a quality product and a quality product is what you want. Is there anytihng better than a well made lasagna? Maybe winning the lottery or finding a hunded dollar bill on the ground, but the point is that list is short.</p>
        <p>ith all of the steps involved it can be tricky trying to keep track of everything that needs to be done in order to achieve that perfect blend of creamy cheeses, meaty sauce, crispy top, and perfectly cooked noodles soaking in all that flavor. Thus I offer this guide to lead you to greatness and allow you to welcome your family to pasta Valhalla. Feel free to experiment with what works for you family taste preferences like using only Italian sausage, or not using it at all and only using ground beef. I've even used lanb before, try it out. </p>
